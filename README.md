# Open-CV-Image-Detection


This repository contains a project focused on detecting dots that resemble STOP signs in images using Python and OpenCV. The program loads an image, processes it, and identifies objects that match the characteristics of a STOP sign, marking them with a green rectangle.

## Features

- **STOP Sign Detection**: Detects STOP-sign-like objects in an image using OpenCV's `CascadeClassifier`.
- **Visualization**: Displays the original image with detected STOP signs outlined in green.
- **Customizable Detection**: Detection parameters (like `minSize`) can be modified to suit your requirements.

## Requirements

- Python 3.x
- OpenCV
- Matplotlib

Install the required libraries using:

```bash
pip install opencv-python opencv-python-headless matplotlib
```

## Output
When you run the code, keeping in mind you have installed all the underlying dependencies, this is the output you will get
